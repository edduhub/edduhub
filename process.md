Database Setup & Migrations (Top Priority):

Goal: Establish a stable, version-controlled database schema.
Tasks:
Finalize the schema design for all your models: users, colleges, students, courses, lectures, enrollments, attendance, quizzes, questions, answer_options, quiz_attempts, student_answers, placements, departments, assignments, assignment_submissions, resources, announcements.
Choose and implement a database migration tool (e.g., golang-migrate/migrate).
Write the initial migration scripts to create all tables, columns, indexes, and foreign key relationships.
Why: Everything else depends on a working database.
Configuration Management:

Goal: Manage application settings cleanly.
Tasks:
Centralize configurations (DB connection, Kratos/Keto URLs, API port, etc.).
Use environment variables (e.g., with godotenv for local dev) or a config library (e.g., Viper).
Why: Adaptability to different environments (dev, staging, production).
API Layer - Initial Setup & User Authentication:

Goal: Enable user sign-up/login and secure API endpoints.
Tasks:
Set up your HTTP router/framework (e.g., Gin, Echo).
Create API handlers for user registration and login, integrating with your UserService and Kratos.
Implement middleware for authenticating API requests (verifying Kratos sessions/tokens).
Start basic Keto integration in middleware or handlers for initial permission checks (e.g., a user can access their own profile).
Why: The entry point for all user interactions.
College Management (Admin Foundation):

Goal: Allow administrators to manage colleges (essential for multi-tenancy).
Tasks:
Ensure the /home/tgt/Desktop/edduhub/server/internal/models/college.go model is complete.
Implement the /home/tgt/Desktop/edduhub/server/internal/repository/college_repository.go (You've already got a great start on this from our previous discussion!).
Create /home/tgt/Desktop/edduhub/server/internal/services/college/college_service.go for business logic.
Develop API handlers for CRUD operations on Colleges.
Secure these endpoints for admin roles using Keto.
Add CollegeRepository to your main /home/tgt/Desktop/edduhub/server/internal/repository/repository.go struct and its constructor.
Why: Foundational for organizing all other entities if you're supporting multiple institutions.
Phase 2: Core Academic Features - APIs & Services

With the basics in place, you can now build out the core academic functionalities.

User Profile API:

Goal: Allow users to view and manage their own profiles.
Tasks: Implement API handlers for authenticated users to get/update their profiles (using UserService).
Why: Basic self-service functionality.
Student Management API (Admin/Staff):

Goal: Enable management of student records.
Tasks:
Implement API handlers for creating, reading, updating, and freezing/unfreezing student accounts (using StudentService).
Ensure students are correctly linked to User and College entities.
Secure endpoints with Keto for appropriate roles.
Why: Core to the educational platform.
Course Management API (Admin/Instructor):

Goal: Enable management of courses.
Tasks:
Implement API handlers for CRUD on courses (using CourseService).
Secure endpoints with Keto.
Why: Central academic units.
Enrollment Management API (Student/Instructor/Admin):

Goal: Manage how students are connected to courses.
Tasks:
APIs for students to enroll/view enrolled courses.
APIs for instructors/admins to view class rosters and manage enrollment statuses (using EnrollmentService).
Why: Forms the basis of class participation.
Lecture Management (Foundation for Content & Attendance):

Goal: Structure course content delivery and enable detailed attendance.
Tasks:
Finalize the Lecture model in /home/tgt/Desktop/edduhub/server/internal/models/course.go (or a dedicated lecture.go). Ensure it has fields like title, description, start_time, end_time, course_id, college_id.
Create and implement /home/tgt/Desktop/edduhub/server/internal/repository/lecture_repository.go.
Create and implement /home/tgt/Desktop/edduhub/server/internal/services/lecture/lecture_service.go.
Develop API handlers for CRUD operations on lectures.
Why: Prerequisite for detailed attendance and structured course content.
Phase 3: Interactive & Assessment Features - APIs & Services

Now, add features that involve more direct user interaction.

Attendance System API (Student/Instructor):

Goal: Implement attendance tracking.
Tasks:
APIs for instructors to generate QR codes for lectures (using GenerateQRCode from AttendanceService).
API for students to submit QR code content for marking attendance (using ProcessQRCode).
APIs for instructors to manually mark/update attendance.
APIs for viewing attendance records.
APIs for freezing/unfreezing attendance.
Why: Core classroom interaction.
Quiz System API (Student/Instructor):

Goal: Implement online quizzes and assessments.
Tasks:
Instructor APIs: Create quizzes, add/edit/delete questions (MCQ, T/F, Short Answer) and options.
Student APIs: View available quizzes, start attempts, submit answers.
System/Instructor APIs: End attempts, auto-grade, allow manual grading, update scores (using QuizService).
Why: Essential for student assessment.
Phase 4: Supporting Features, Polish & Expansion

Add more specialized features and refine the platform.

Assignment Management (Student/Instructor):

Goal: Manage and grade assignments.
Tasks:
Define Assignment and AssignmentSubmission models.
Create corresponding repositories and services.
Develop APIs for creating assignments, submitting work, and grading.
Integrate file storage if assignments involve uploads (e.g., local disk for dev, S3 for prod).
Why: Key for coursework and evaluation.
Department Management API (Admin):

Goal: Add organizational structure within colleges.
Tasks:
Define Department model.
Create repository and service.
Develop APIs for CRUD on departments.
Why: Useful for role assignments and resource scoping.
Resource/File Management (Instructor/Student):

Goal: Allow sharing of learning materials.
Tasks:
Define Resource model.
Create repository and service (handling uploads, downloads, Keto permissions).
Develop APIs for uploading and downloading materials.
Why: Facilitates content sharing.
Placement Management API (Admin/Student):

Goal: Track student job placements.
Tasks: Implement APIs for CRUD on placement records (using PlacementService).
Why: Important for tracking student outcomes.
Announcement Management API (Admin/Instructor/Student):

Goal: Enable communication within the platform.
Tasks:
Define Announcement model.
Create repository and service.
Develop APIs for creating and viewing announcements (scoped to college/course).
Why: Key communication tool.
Phase 5: Frontend, Testing, Deployment & Iteration

Bring it all together for the end-user and ensure long-term health.

Frontend Development:

Goal: Create the user interface.
Tasks: Develop the frontend application (React, Vue, Angular, etc.). This can often run in parallel with backend API development once API contracts are stable.
Why: How users interact with your platform.
Comprehensive Testing:

Goal: Ensure code quality and reliability.
Tasks:
Write thorough unit tests for all service logic.
Write integration tests for API endpoints (covering handler -> service -> repository flow with a test database).
Consider E2E tests (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) if you have a frontend.
Why: Catches bugs, prevents regressions.
Deployment & Operations:

Goal: Make the application accessible and maintainable.
Tasks:
Dockerize your backend.
Set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).
Choose and configure a deployment platform (Kubernetes, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).
Implement robust logging and monitoring.
Why: Gets your application to users and helps you keep it running smoothly.
Feedback & Iteration:

Goal: Continuously improve the platform.
Tasks: Gather user feedback, prioritize bug fixes, and plan new feature enhancements.
Why: The lifeblood of a successful product.
Key Considerations Throughout:

Keto Integration: Continuously define Keto relationships and implement permission checks as you build out each API.
Service Layer: Keep business logic in services, not handlers.
Error Handling & Validation: Be consistent and thorough.
Git: Use it well! Frequent commits, clear messages, branches.
